# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates will always only be applied to the latest version of Watchtower.
As the software by default is set to auto-update if you use the `latest` tag, you will get these security updates automatically as soon as they are released.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Critical vulnerabilities that might open up for external attacks are best reported directly to nick@nickfedor.com.
I'll always try to get back to you as swiftly as possible, but keep in mind that since this is a personal fork of a community project, I can't really leave any guarantees about the speed.

Non-critical vulnerabilities may be reported as regular GitHub issues.
